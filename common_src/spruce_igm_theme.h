/*
 * Look and feel of the spruce in-game menu, loaded once per process from an
 * igm.json on the card.
 *
 * Read once, on the first menu open. A settings change therefore lands on the
 * next game launch, which is a new process. Nothing here is polled per frame.
 *
 * Missing keys keep their built-in default, so a colourway only has to list the
 * colours it cares about. A file that fails to parse is discarded whole and the
 * built-in look is used - the parse target is a scratch copy that is only
 * committed on success, so a truncated file can never leave a half-applied
 * theme on screen.
 *
 * Values are NOT range-checked. A theme that asks for a panel taller than the
 * screen gets one. This is deliberate.
