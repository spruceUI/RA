# H700 is 4x Cortex-A53, so in aarch32 this is ARMv8-A 32-bit, not ARMv7.
# -mfpu=neon-fp-armv8 gets the ARMv8 FP/SIMD unit rather than the toolchain
# default (vfpv3-d16), which has no NEON at all. RetroArch appends its own
# -mfpu=neon -marm to its hand-written NEON objects, which is correct for
# them - that asm is ARMv7 NEON - and only affects those files.

# the IR, and it does so against whatever target the *link* command names - so
# omitting -mcpu here silently rebuilds everything for the toolchain default.
# That is not theoretical: -mcpu=cortex-a53 defines __ARM_FEATURE_CRC32, which
# switches libretro-common/encodings/encoding_crc32.c onto the __crc32b/__crc32d
# ACLE builtins, and lto-wrapper then rejected them as "not supported for this
# target" because the default arm target has no CRC extension.

# Configure for the H700 in 32-bit mode.
#
# Targets BOTH userlands. Stock Anbernic is Ubuntu with a full 32-bit multilib
# in /usr/lib32, so it needs nothing extra. BaseOS harvests only one armhf
# library of its own (libc.so.6, so the vendor bluetooth binary runs), so
# spruce supplies the rest of the 32-bit stack on the card - see
# AnbernicXXCommon.cfg. The kernel side is already proven: BaseOS runs that
# armhf bluetooth binary, so aarch32 EL0 works.
#
# Two things this has that ra32.universal does not:
#
# --enable-neon: the universal armhf build leaves HAVE_NEON at its default of
#   no, which drops RetroArch's NEON sinc/CC resamplers, its NEON memcpy and
#   the s16<->float audio conversions. Those are per-frame paths and the A53
#   has the SIMD unit sitting idle otherwise. On aarch64 this flag is moot
#   (NEON is architectural), which is why ra64.h700 disables it - here it is
#   a real gain and the main reason a 32-bit h700 target is worth having.
# --enable-mali_fbdev: same reasoning as ra64.h700 - reach the Mali blob
#   directly instead of RetroArch -> SDL2 -> mali fbdev EGL. Safe to enable
#   even where it may not suit: video_context_driver_init_first falls through
#   to the remaining context drivers if fbdev_mali fails to initialise.
#
# --disable-vulkan: no 32-bit Vulkan driver on these devices.
# --disable-kms: nothing to bind to on either userland.
#
# Note on input under BaseOS: the stock 32-bit SDL2 dlopens libudev, so its
# joystick enumeration finds nothing where no udevd runs. RetroArch's linuxraw
# joypad driver reads /dev/input/js* through the legacy API with no udev and no
# SDL, which is why --enable-udev and --enable-sdl2 are both kept but neither
# is load-bearing there. Driver choice is made in the platform cfg, not here.
